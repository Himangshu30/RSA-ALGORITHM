# RSA-ALGORITHM

Python script that encrypts and decrypts a text based on RSA algorithm
It involves the concept of modular arithmatic and euler's theorem.
It is also based on the idea that factorizing large numbers requires years.
Here, the (a,n) are kept public and (p,q,b) are kept private.


Usage
For Windows users:

$ python RSA_Algorithm.py
For Mac/Linux/Unix users:

$ ./RSA_Algorithm.py
